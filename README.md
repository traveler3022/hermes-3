⬡ What is this?
Hermes Agent is a powerful open-source AI agent from Nous Research. It normally runs on a desktop.
Hermes2 is the first native Android port — bringing the same agent to your phone with a proper Material 3 interface, instead of typing commands into a terminal.
The agent does the work — chatting, running tools, writing code. This app gives it a comfortable home on Android: a real chat screen, config, sessions, skills, and tool-approval notifications.
[!IMPORTANT] This is a power-user tool, not a casual chat app. Hermes Agent can run real commands on your device (inside Termux). If you only want to chat with an AI, a normal chat app fits better. If you want a real agent that can do things on your phone — this is for you. Please read Privacy & Security before installing.

The app talks to Hermes Agent over a local WebSocket on 127.0.0.1 — that link stays entirely on your device. Hermes runs the AI logic; the Android app is the native front-end.
⬡ Privacy & Security — read first
[!WARNING] This section matters. Please read it fully before installing.
🟢 Stays on your phone


Your API key
Stored in Hermes' own config (~/.hermes/.env) inside Termux, on your device. This app sends your key to no server of ours. No account, no backend, no telemetry.
App ↔ agent link
Runs over 127.0.0.1 (loopback). Never leaves the device.
🟠 Leaves your phone


Your messages to the AI
Go to the model provider you chose — that's how any AI API works. Pick MiMo → Xiaomi sees it; pick Gemini → Google sees it.
Rule of thumb
Don't send anything you wouldn't want the provider to see. Be mindful of providers whose data laws you're unsure about.
🛡️ What the agent can do on your device
Hermes can run shell commands inside Termux. Thanks to Android's app sandbox, on a non-rooted phone this is confined to Termux's own storage — the agent cannot reach other apps' data or system files. This is real, built-in protection.
[!CAUTION] Do not root your phone to run this. Rooting removes the sandbox that keeps the agent contained.
✅ Tool approval — keep it on
Hermes asks before running commands it considers dangerous. Prompts appear as Android notifications with Approve / Deny buttons. Leave approval enabled, especially while you're new — it's the line of defense that stops a destructive command before it runs. When in doubt, Deny, then ask the agent what it was trying to do.
[!NOTE] This app is provided as-is under the MIT license. You are responsible for the keys you use, the provider you choose, and the commands you approve.

⬇ Download the latest APK
Always-fresh debug build — rebuilt automatically on every push.
�

[!NOTE] This is a debug build (unsigned, for testing). Install only if you trust the source and understand the security notes above.
⬡ Installation
You need two pieces: Termux (runs the agent) and the Hermes2 app (the interface). Set up Termux first.
① Install Termux
Install Termux from F-Droid → f-droid.org/packages/com.termux
[!WARNING] Do not install Termux from the Play Store — that version is abandoned and won't work.
② Allow external apps in Termux
Lets Hermes2 start commands in Termux:
mkdir -p ~/.termux
echo 'allow-external-apps=true' >> ~/.termux/termux.properties
Then force-stop and reopen Termux to apply it.
③ Install Hermes Agent
Run the official installer in Termux:
pkg update -y && pkg install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
⏱️ First install takes 5–15 min (compiles Rust crates for ARM). Keep the screen on.
Verify:
hermes --version
hermes doctor
④ Install the App
Download the APK from the link above.
Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings.
Open the APK and install.
⑤ Connect
Open Hermes2
Tap Runtime Setup
Tap Start Gateway
Wait 30–90 s on first launch (Python boot + plugin scan — only slow once)
Status shows ● Connected → start chatting
Later launches reconnect automatically. No need to repeat setup.
⬡ Model Setup
Set the key once, inside Termux. Two low-cost options that work well on a phone:
�
Option A — Xiaomi MiMo · recommended, low-cost & fast
�


In Termux: nano ~/.hermes/.env and add:
XIAOMI_API_KEY=your_key_here
XIAOMI_BASE_URL=https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1
Save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X), then:
hermes config set model.provider xiaomi
hermes config set model.default mimo-v2.5-free
Model names to try in order if one is unavailable: mimo-v2.5-free → mimo-v2.5 → mimo-v2.5-pro
�

�
Option B — Google Gemini
�


In Termux: nano ~/.hermes/.env and add:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
Then:
hermes config set model.provider gemini
hermes config set model.default gemini-2.5-flash
�

[!CAUTION] Keep your key private. Anyone with your key can spend your credits. Never paste it into screenshots, chats, or public issues. If it leaks → revoke it in the provider dashboard and generate a new one.
⬡ Controlling Costs
Most providers bill per token. To avoid surprises:
💳 Set a spending limit in your provider's dashboard (MiMo, Google, OpenRouter all support this) — your single best protection.
🆓 Start with a free / cheap model like mimo-v2.5-free while learning the agent's behavior.
👀 Watch the first few sessions to feel how many tokens a task uses.
⬡ Troubleshooting
�
App stuck on "Connecting…" forever
�


Cold-start takes 30–90 s. Wait, then check logs in Termux:
cat ~/.hermes/logs/gateway_stdout.log
If Termux says Hermes is running but the app won't connect: force-stop & reopen Termux once (to apply allow-external-apps=true), then start the gateway again.
�

�
jiter / pydantic-core build fails during install
�


Set these in Termux before running the installer, then retry:
export CARGO_HOME="$HOME/.hermes/cargo"
export CARGO_REGISTRIES_CRATES_IO_PROTOCOL=sparse
export CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=false
export CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS=16
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1
�

�
hermes: command not found
�


cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
ln -sf "$PWD/venv/bin/hermes" "$PREFIX/bin/hermes"
which hermes
�

�
Disconnects when the screen turns off
�


A foreground service keeps the gateway alive, but aggressive battery savers can still kill it:
Settings → Apps → Hermes2 → Battery → Unrestricted
Do the same for Termux if it persists.

All UI and ViewModel code depends only on interfaces. Swapping the Termux runtime for an embedded Python runtime (ADR-009) requires changing only the DI module — no UI or ViewModel changes. The agent link is JSON-RPC over a local WebSocket.
