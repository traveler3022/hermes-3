# Dev Session Log

Running log of development sessions. **Newest session on top.** Each session
records: what was decided, what was done, what was deliberately skipped, and
where to pick up next. Read this first when resuming work.

## 2026-07-05 (4) — Reality check: what's actually wired vs. just defined

User pushback (correct): the previous session's survey was about *extra*
desktop features to consider — it missed that big chunks of THIS app's own
protocol surface are unwired. Did a hard audit instead of a wishlist: grepped
every `GatewayMethods` constant for real call sites in `ui/viewmodel/*` and
`service/*` (excluding the definition file itself).

### Confirmed: zero wiring

- **Plugins — completely absent.** `PLUGINS_LIST` / `PLUGINS_MANAGE` are
  defined in `GatewayRequest.kt` and never called anywhere. No screen, no
  ViewModel, nothing. `PlatformsScreen.kt` (similar name) is unrelated — it's
  messaging-platform bridges (Telegram/Discord), not plugins. This isn't a
  half-feature, it's a zero-feature: needs a screen + ViewModel from scratch,
  same shape as `SkillsScreen`/`SkillsViewModel` (which IS properly wired —
  use it as the template).
- Other dead constants (defined, 0 call sites): `SESSION_STATUS`,
  `SESSION_ACTIVE_LIST`, `TOOLS_SHOW`, `TOOLSETS_LIST`, `MODEL_DISCONNECT`,
  `CONFIG_GET`, `COMPLETE_SLASH`, `TERMINAL_RESIZE`.

### Confirmed: "Settings" is really just "Model settings"

Upstream's single `config.set` RPC accepts 15 distinct keys (grepped the
`@method("config.set")` handler body in `tui_gateway/server.py`): `model`,
`fast`, `busy`, `verbose`, `yolo`, `reasoning`, `details_mode`,
`thinking_mode`, `compact`, `statusbar`, `mouse`, `indicator`, `prompt`,
`personality`, `skin`.

`ConfigViewModel.kt` only ever sends `key = "model"`. `ConfigScreen.kt` is
almost entirely `QuickModelSwitch` + per-provider fallback toggles — there is
no UI for yolo (auto-approve mode), reasoning effort, agent personality,
thinking-mode display, compact/statusbar layout, etc. 14 of 15 config keys
have no UI path at all.

### Revised priority (supersedes the desktop-survey list where they conflict)

These are real gaps in THIS app, not desktop nice-to-haves — rank above the
artifacts gallery from the previous entry:

1. **Plugins screen + ViewModel** — build from scratch, mirror
   `SkillsScreen.kt`/`SkillsViewModel.kt` structure (`skills.manage` →
   `plugins.manage`, `skills.reload` → same pattern). Needs its own nav entry.
2. **Expand ConfigScreen to the other 14 `config.set` keys** — at minimum
   surface `yolo` (auto-approve toggle — directly affects the approval-prompt
   UX from the 2026-07-05(2) session) and `reasoning`/`thinking_mode` (model
   behavior users actually care about). `personality`/`skin`/`compact` are
   lower-stakes cosmetic ones, can come later.
3. Then continue with `session.steer` / artifacts gallery / session hygiene
   RPCs from the previous entry.

### Method for next time

Don't trust the existence of a `GatewayMethods` constant as evidence a
feature works. Grep `GatewayMethods\.<NAME>\b` across `ui/` and `service/`
excluding `GatewayRequest.kt` itself — zero hits means it's dead. Re-run this
sweep after adding new constants so half-wired features get caught immediately
instead of surfacing as a user complaint.

## 2026-07-05 (3) — Desktop feature survey: what to port, what to skip

Research only, no code changes. User asked what else from the official
desktop client (`apps/desktop/`, Electron+React, same protocol) is worth
porting to Android — explicitly wants to avoid dragging over desktop-only
cruft. Surveyed `apps/desktop/src/app/*` (feature-module folders) and
`apps/desktop/src/components/*`, cross-checked against what this app already
has (Chat/Sessions/Skills/Cron/Config/Platforms/RuntimeSetup/Onboarding
screens + the model picker already in `ConfigScreen.kt`).

### Worth porting (highest value first)

1. **`session.steer`** (already top of the backlog from the previous
   session) — redirect the agent mid-turn without interrupting it. Biggest
   UX gap, protocol method already exists server-side, nothing UI-side yet.
2. **Artifacts/session gallery** — `apps/desktop/src/app/artifacts/index.tsx`
   (673 lines) scans a session's messages for images/files/links the agent
   produced and shows them as a paginated gallery (zoomable images, copy,
   download). We already built the hard part of this
   (`ChatViewModel.resolveMediaUrl` → gateway `/api/files/download`) for
   inline chat images; this would reuse that to add a dedicated "Files" tab
   per session instead of only seeing media inline in the transcript.
3. **`session.undo` / `session.compress` / `session.save`** — session
   hygiene RPCs the desktop exposes that we don't call at all yet.
4. **`prompt.background` + `background.complete` UI** — we parse
   `background.complete` as an event already (`GatewayEvent.BackgroundComplete`)
   but there's no way to actually kick off a background task from the UI.

### Deliberately skip (desktop-only or low value on a phone)

- **`starmap`** — a force-directed canvas graph with its own physics/geometry
  engine (`simulation.ts`, `render.ts`, `geometry.ts`...). Desktop screen
  real estate only; not a mobile pattern at all.
- **`pet.*` RPC family** (`pet.hatch/gallery/generate/rename/scale/...`) — a
  full virtual-pet subsystem. Fun but a large, separate feature surface;
  not a gap, a whole new product area. Revisit only if explicitly requested.
- **`messaging` / `command-center`** — multi-platform bridge management
  (Telegram/Discord/Slack bot start/stop). Irrelevant: this app *is* the
  client, not a bridge manager.
- **`command-palette`** — keyboard-driven desktop pattern, no mobile
  equivalent worth building.
- **`shell` (raw terminal view)** — we already surface tool execution as
  tool-call cards; a raw terminal pane doesn't fit the mobile chat UX.
- **`profiles` (multi-home CRUD)** — desktop power-user feature for managing
  multiple `~/.hermes`-style profiles. Skip until someone actually asks for
  multi-account support.
- **`agents` panel** (`apps/desktop/src/app/agents/index.tsx`, richer
  subagent tree with pause/interrupt) — we already show a basic
  `ChatMessage.SubagentCard` per `GatewayEvent.SubagentEvent`. The desktop
  version is nicer (tree view, elapsed timers, stream log) but this is
  polish on an existing feature, not a functional gap — low priority.
- **`learning/archive-skill-confirm-dialog.tsx`** — trivial, one dialog;
  fold into `SkillsScreen.kt` later if it comes up, not worth a dedicated pass.
- **Model picker** — already have an equivalent (`ConfigScreen.kt` model
  selection UI), nothing to port here.

### Next pick, in order

`session.steer` → artifacts/session gallery → `session.undo`/`compress`/`save`
→ `prompt.background` UI. Everything in "deliberately skip" should NOT be
revisited without an explicit ask — don't rediscover this list from scratch.

## 2026-07-05 (2) — Two user-reported bugs: file sending, disconnect garbage

**Branch:** `claude/dev-session-log-review-lmpwa7` (continued after PR #3 merged)

User report (paraphrased): "the app doesn't send files now" and "when it
disconnects, chat here fills up and there [the agent] stops."

### Found and fixed (commit `1e8e078`)

1. **Send button disabled for attachment-only messages** — `ChatScreen.kt`
   `InputBar`'s Send button was `enabled = text.isNotBlank()`. `sendMessage()`
   already supports sending a picked file/image with no typed text, but the
   button could never be pressed in that case — a picked attachment could
   never actually be sent. Fixed: `enabled = text.isNotBlank() ||
   pendingAttachments.isNotEmpty()`. This is almost certainly the "doesn't
   send files" report.
2. **Disconnect marker corrupted the chat message** —
   `finalizeOrphanedStreamingMessage()` in `ChatViewModel.kt` had
   `"$msg.text\n\n$marker"`. Classic Kotlin string-template trap: `$msg`
   interpolates the *whole* `ChatMessage.Assistant.toString()` (every field:
   id, timestamp, text, isStreaming, reasoning), then appends the literal
   text `.text` — the intended `msg.text` property access never happens.
   So on every disconnect, the chat message got replaced with an object-dump
   wall of text instead of a clean "(connection lost)" continuation. This is
   almost certainly the "chat fills up with garbage" report. Fixed to
   `"${msg.text}\n\n$marker"`.

### Investigated but NOT changed — documented risk, not a confirmed bug

Suspected a second cause: `OkHttpGatewayClient`'s internal auto-`resumeSession()`
(fired on reconnect, using its own `lastSessionId`) resolves a session id that
`ChatViewModel.activeSessionId` never learns about, so a later `prompt.submit`
could target a stale id. Traced through the upstream `session.resume` handler
(`docs/upstream-reference` doesn't include `server.py`'s handler, but the
fetched copy in scratch showed it): there's a **fast path** —
`_find_live_session_by_key` — that reuses the *same* session id whenever the
gateway process is still alive (true for the common case: the socket dropped
but Termux/the gateway process kept running). A *new* id is only minted on a
**cold** resume (gateway process itself restarted/session evicted). So this
gap is real but narrow — likely not what the user is hitting day-to-day.
**Not fixed this session** — fixing it well means either (a) propagating the
resumed session id back through `ConnectionState`/a new event and having
`ChatViewModel` adopt it, or (b) having the low-level client stop
auto-resuming and let `ChatViewModel`'s own (already correct, transcript-aware)
`resumeSession()` own reconnection entirely. Both are real behavior changes to
the reconnect path with regression risk — worth a dedicated session rather
than a rushed bolt-on. **Next time this comes up**: check
`OkHttpGatewayClient.resumeSession()` and `ChatViewModel`'s connection-state
collector (`connectAndCollect()`) together.

### CI

Pushed as `1e8e078`; build-apk.yml run #46 triggered, verify before closing
out (see whichever run is latest on this branch if picking this up later).

## 2026-07-05 — Stop the whack-a-mole: port from reference, not from scratch

**Branch:** `claude/dev-session-log-review-lmpwa7`

### Problem statement

Features were being reverse-engineered one at a time against a moving target
(the gateway protocol), so every fix surfaced a new mystery. Hypothesis
tested and **confirmed**: the protocol is identical for every Hermes client
(Termux-local, remote server, upstream's own TUI/desktop) — only the
transport URL differs. The upstream repo ships reference clients whose wiring
can be ported 1:1 instead of rediscovered.

### Decisions

1. **Single source of truth**: all protocol work is ported from
   `docs/upstream-reference/` (snapshot of NousResearch/hermes-agent
   @ `605727e3`, see its README). No more guessing payload shapes.
2. **Do not port everything.** The reference README keeps a
   "deliberately NOT ported" list (terminal.resize, rollback.*, moa.*,
   voice RPCs, spawn_tree.*, billing.*) — don't rediscover those.
3. Protocol drift is checked with `scripts/check-upstream-drift.sh`
   (run it when something protocol-shaped breaks, or periodically).

### Done this session

- **Vendored upstream reference** → `docs/upstream-reference/`
  (`ws.py`, `gatewayTypes.ts`, `gatewayClient.ts`,
  `createGatewayEventHandler.ts`, `turnController.ts` + README with the
  pinned commit and usage guide). Commit `569e37c`.
- **Drift-check script** → `scripts/check-upstream-drift.sh`
  (`--update` moves the pin). Verified green against upstream main.
  Commit `a69f38a`.
- **Closed protocol gaps** (commit `77aa082`), all ported from the reference:
  - `tool.complete.error` was never parsed → tool failures were silently
    shown as successes. Now parsed and rendered on the ToolCall card.
  - `todos` on `tool.start`/`tool.complete` → new `AgentTodoCard`
    (collapsible, above input bar) shows the agent's live task list.
    Cleared on each new prompt (per-turn, like upstream turnController).
  - `approval.request.allow_permanent` → notification now offers
    **Approve / Always / Deny**; "Always" hidden when the gateway caps
    scope. Canonical response choices (`once`/`always`/`deny`) replace the
    non-canonical `"approve"`, which used to skip the gateway's
    persistence logic entirely.

### Findings worth remembering

- **False alarm**: suspected method renames (`reload.mcp` vs `mcp.reload`,
  `config.get` vs `config.get_value`) were wrong — verified against
  upstream `server.py` dispatch table; our `GatewayMethods` names are all
  correct. The suspicion came from an unreliable web summary — always
  verify against the vendored files.
- Upstream `approval.request` no longer documents `pattern_keys`; we still
  parse it (harmless if absent) for older gateways.
- Approval choice values accepted by the gateway:
  `once` | `session` | `always` | `deny` (`tools/approval.py`,
  `_ApprovalEntry.result`). Anything not "deny" unblocks, but only
  `session`/`always` persist.

### Not done / next candidates (in rough priority order)

1. ~~**Verify build via CI**~~ ✅ done — run #42 (`build-apk.yml`) green on
   `395d96c`, so all of the above compiles and the debug APK builds.
2. `session.steer` — redirect the agent mid-turn (upstream has it, big UX win).
3. `session.undo` / `session.compress` / `session.save` — session hygiene.
4. `prompt.background` + `background.complete` UI — long tasks without
   blocking the chat.
5. UI option to answer approvals in-chat (card buttons), not only via
   notification — the in-chat Status message is currently display-only.
6. `moa.*`, voice, rollback — see "deliberately NOT ported" before picking
   any of these up.

### How to continue from here

Read `docs/upstream-reference/README.md`, run
`scripts/check-upstream-drift.sh`, pick the next candidate above, find its
handling in the reference TS files, port to Kotlin. Log the session here.
